<b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
</b>**<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Hi 
everyone, In this article we'll try to explore the art of setting goals. 
Actually setting goals are the common things which we aware about. But only 
few people achieve their goals. I think you catch up!** 
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
</b>**<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Yeah!, all 
of us are setting goals but we fail to make it. If you sit back and relax you 
could find the mistakes you've done on goal setting.** 
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
</b>**<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Goal is a 
term which is used to determine the dream and passion you have to achieve. 
<span style="color: #741b47;">*Until you achieve everything is a dream*. You 
dreams are converted into goal only, if you follow on your own track to 
achieve what you determined to do.** 
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
</b>**<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The aim is 
different from goals. If you wanna become a pilot it is an aim, and if you 
want to become a pilot you should know about flight control systems,and about 
space whether conditions. Not only ended up with that, it further goes some 
extent. And the qualities that needed to accomplish your aim is the goals you 
should fix and achieve. The flight control system and space whether conditions 
are the qualities you needed. You need to fix some short term goals to excel 
on all one by one. Then one day, definitely you'll meet up your aim.** 
<b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
</b>**<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Goal 
setting is not for setting up,it should meet it's aim.** 


<div style="text-align: center;">  **<span style="font-size: large;"> " A goal 
without a plan is only a dream"**
