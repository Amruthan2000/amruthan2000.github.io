Hey guys when you go through the fins chapter under Heat and Mass Transfer, you could notice sinh, 
tanh and cosh functions on the book. Now I'll show you how to get these function values. 


STEP 1: 
             Use hyp function present in your calculator. 
STEP 2: 
             Now select cos, sin, tan it will display such as Cosh, tanh, 
sinh. 

Thats it, unfortunately you only do this in fins ever in mechanical 
engineering. 

Comment what you are interested on the comments.
