<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h4 style="text-align: 
justify;">*Artificial Intelligence is programming a device or a robot to think 
like a human . How interesting it would be if you are one of the developer in 
this emerging industry . Many of our daily products now meet the needs of 
artificial Intelligence . So here let we discuss the primary requirements that 
the power packed industry need from you .<div class="separator" style="clear: 
both; text-align: center;">[<img border="0" data-original-height="501"

style="text-align: left;">*Still If you not aware about the growth of 
Artificial Intelligence please read this article , [<font

<div>***Data Science Fundamentals :***<div style="text-align: justify;">***    
                                             **You need not to master but you 
should develop you skills in data science because you are going to work with 
data that will make tremendous change in the world in the name of Artificial 
Intelligence . You should do some certificate courses to understand the 
concepts of Data Science . Feeling confused about which course to choose ? 
We'll guide you .*<div><i> 
</i><div>***Linear Regression Analysis :***<div>*                              
                 It is a subject related to Mathematics which is very 
important for developing algorithms . Know more about Linear regression 
analysis .*<div><i> 
</i><div>***Cloud Computing :***<div style="text-align: justify;">*            
                   You people may wonder how does cloud computing is 
incorporated with Artificial Intelligence , yeah the cloud storage is the best 
storage service which is more reliable and fast . So the program you would 
develop would be hosted in cloud to make changes easily in order to achieve 
any updates .*<div><i> 
</i><div>***Graphic Modelling :** *<div style="text-align: justify;">*         
                       Graphic Modelling , product designing are the most 
preferred skills that they would expect from Mechanical Engineers . Basically 
mechanical engineers would have good computing skills and designing skills . 
If you work hard in this area , you have high chance to get placed .*<div 
style="text-align: justify;"><i> 
</i><div>***Machine Learning Algorithms :***<div style="text-align: 
justify;">*                                                   Machine Learning 
is a subset of Artificial Intelligence . Machine Learning makes the machine to 
learn and implement the work flow as like how human works . Read this article 
to get thorough understanding about [<font color="#f57c00">Machine
