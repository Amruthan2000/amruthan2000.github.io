Artificial Intelligence is programming a device or a robot to think like a human . How interesting it would be if you are one of the developer in this emerging industry . Many of our daily products now meet the needs of artificial Intelligence . So here let we discuss the primary requirements that the power packed industry need from you. Still If you not aware about the growth of Artificial Intelligence please read this article , Artificial Intelligence.

* Data Science Fundamentals 
* Linear regression Analysis 
* Cloud Computing
* Graphic Modelling 
* Machine Learning Algorithms 

**Data Science Fundamentals :**
                                                 You need not to master but you should develop you skills in data science because you are going to work with data that will make tremendous change in the world in the name of Artificial Intelligence . You should do some certificate courses to understand the concepts of Data Science . Feeling confused about which course to choose ? We'll guide you .

**Linear Regression Analysis :**
                                               It is a subject related to Mathematics which is very important for developing algorithms . Know more about Linear regression analysis .

**Cloud Computing :**
                               You people may wonder how does cloud computing is incorporated with Artificial Intelligence , yeah the cloud storage is the best storage service which is more reliable and fast . So the program you would develop would be hosted in cloud to make changes easily in order to achieve any updates .

**Graphic Modelling :** 
                                Graphic Modelling , product designing are the most preferred skills that they would expect from Mechanical Engineers . Basically mechanical engineers would have good computing skills and designing skills . If you work hard in this area , you have high chance to get placed .

**Machine Learning Algorithms :**
                                                   Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence . Machine Learning makes the machine to learn and implement the work flow as like how human works . Read this article to get thorough understanding about Machine Learning .
