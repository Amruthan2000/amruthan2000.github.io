**Machine Learning** is an important part of computer science and 
artificial intelligence. But the major part is of mechanical Science.

The period of machines and robots have recently started. The eventual 
fate of machine is huge and is past our extent of creative mind. Indeed, 
Mechanical Engineers can learn machine learning. You need a ton of programming 
information however. In any case, you can generally learn. The above all else prerequisite is to have a decent grasp on a 
programming language, ideally python as it is anything but difficult to learn 
and its applications are more extensive than some other language. Python is 
the lingua franca of Machine Learning.

It is essential to have a decent comprehension of themes like Data structures, 
Memory the board, and classes. In spite of the fact that Python is a generally 
excellent Language, only it can't support you. You will most likely need to 
become familiar with every one of these programming languages like C++, R, 
Python, Java and furthermore chip away at MapReduce sooner or later.

Thank you for reading, see you in next post.
