Machine Learning is an important part of computer science and artificial intelligence. But the major part is of mechanical Science.
The period of machines and robots have recently started. The eventual fate of machine is huge and is past our extent of creative mind. Indeed, Mechanical Engineers can learn machine learning. You need a ton of programming information however. In any case, you can generally learn. The above all else prerequisite is to have a decent grasp on a programming language, ideally python as it is anything but difficult to learn and its applications are more extensive than some other language. Python is the lingua franca of Machine Learning. 
It is essential to have a decent comprehension of themes like Data structures, Memory the board, and classes. In spite of the fact that Python is a generally excellent Language, only it can't support you. You will most likely need to become familiar with every one of these programming languages like C++, R, Python, Java and furthermore chip away at MapReduce sooner or later.
